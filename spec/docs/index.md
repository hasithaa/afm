# **Welcome to Agent Flavored Markdown (AFM)**

**A specification for describing AI agents in a portable and interoperable way.**

AFM provides a structured, markdown-based format for defining the capabilities, behaviors, and knowledge of AI agents. The goal is to create a universal standard that allows agents to be easily shared, deployed, and understood across different platforms and reference implementations.
